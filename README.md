# TODO

I realize this is early in development, and really I've just been playing around since it's been awhile since I last used RPG Maker. But there's a specific reason I'm going to stop so soon- and I *will* come back later.

I want to make a puppet pals clone, and I had plans on using electron to do so. Since that'll use javascript anyways, I think I may as well implement it in RPG Maker MV as a plugin as well. I'm actually really really excited about this idea, to the point where I want to prioritize that project over this one so that this one will be *so* much better when I get back to it. 

I'm also hoping on making a sort of "template URealms Fan Game" project, which will be a RPG Maker MV project folder with all of the default assets removed (replaced with either official URealms assets or cc0 assets from somewhere else, probably Kenney, just to keep it from feeling too "RPG Maker-y") with all the maps and characters, and of course the puppet pals plugin, to facilitate anyone to make a fan game in the URealms universe.

- Actors for every official tile
- Tilesets based off Meganzoor's maps (with grid overlay using TDDP's BindPicturesToMap plugin)
- Put characters' status (stamina, gold, etc.) on bottom of screen, a la in the streams. (such that the text box would go over this UI during dialogue)
- Anything else I can think of to make it more like the show

I'd like to clarify by fan game I don't mean a game using the URealms roleplaying engine, but rather a video game made by fans of URealms, in that universe. 

For now you have a neat proof of concept showing a URealms map with tiles that hop around on it, and use static puppets in dialogue. Also FYI the puppet pals program, the template game, and any games I make using that template (e.g. One Night in Fenston) will be open source.
